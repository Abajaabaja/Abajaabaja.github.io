<h3 style="font-size: 40px; color: white;">Built in the 15th century by the Incas of Peru, the pyramid city of Machu Picchu was abandoned only a century after its creation during the Spanish Conquest. Since conquistadors never discovered this Lost City of the Incas, it remained largely untouched until its rediscovery in 1911, making it a uniquely preserved and important historical artifact. This lost city features many classic Incan building techniques and has taught us a great deal of what we know about Incan civilization today. A century of careful restoration on many of the buildings allows tourists to see what many of the structures originally looked like, and restoration efforts continue to this day.
