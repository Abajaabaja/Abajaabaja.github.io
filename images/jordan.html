<h3 style="font-size: 40px; color: white;">The historical city of Petra is Jordan’s most recognizable symbol, and also their most visited tourist attraction. This ancient city, carved and built from the living rock possibly as early as 300 B.C., is often called the Rose City because of the pale red hue of the stone from which it was carved. Although Petra is a carefully protected and treasured site, it remained unknown in the Western world until the early 1800s, and was only designated a World Heritage Site very recently. Its inclusion as one of the New Seven Wonders has increased awareness and tourism dramatically.
